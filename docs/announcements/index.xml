      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m excited to announce that today PhaseWorm comes to speedrun.com with an official game leaderboard! PhaseWorm was built for speedrunning, and so I&amp;rsquo;ve also included a livesplit autosplitter for release with the game. Just add this component into livesplit and the game will track your in-game time.
Even if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to use livesplit, you can speedrun phaseworm - the in-game timer will give you your final time and death count when you roll credits!</description>
