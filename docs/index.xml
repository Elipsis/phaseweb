      <description> Fixed a minor typo in the Unity properties for Level 27 - &amp;ldquo;Intersections in Real Time&amp;rdquo; which was causing it not to log player deaths or medals on this stage. Level 25 - &amp;ldquo;Lake Rancid&amp;rdquo; contained a red apple on a brick tile. This was changed to the usual green apple for visiblity reasons.  </description>
