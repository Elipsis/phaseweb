* Refactored all scenes in Unity with a base resolution of 1920x1080, rather than 800x600 (ie: a 16:9 default instead of a 4:3 default).  This should correct an issue with ultrawide resolutions (tested with 2560x1080) while menuing.

* Changed algorithm for in-game dynamic scaling of screen size to support ultra widescreen resolutions as well as 4:3.  This means two algorithms are used, and we always then choose the one which is more zoomed out.
