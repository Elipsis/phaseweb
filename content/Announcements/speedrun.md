I'm excited to announce that today PhaseWorm comes to speedrun.com with an [official game leaderboard](https://www.speedrun.com/phaseworm/)!  PhaseWorm was built for speedrunning, and so I've also included a [livesplit autosplitter](https://github.com/Elipsis/phasesplit/blob/master/PhaseWorm.asl) for release with the game.  Just add this component into livesplit and the game will track your in-game time.

Even if you don't want to use livesplit, you can speedrun phaseworm - the in-game timer will give you your final time and death count when you roll credits!
